      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It handles the content of
          a website, as well as its structure and the meaning of each element on the page. Along with CSS and
          JavaScript, HTML is one of the three core languages of the web.
        </li>
        <li>HTML = CONTENT IN WEBSITE - TEXT, IMAGES, BUTTONS, LINKS
        </li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested
          inside of a

          <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the
            children—in this case, the

            <body> element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to
              explain the relationship among elements in HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS
          style sheet.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the
        property. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that
        property, blue.
      </li>
      <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card,
        will gain these property assignments from the CSS.
      </li>
      <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are
        actually making the entire element bigger.</li>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git add-A The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A
          flag
          indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in
          the
          next commit.
        </li>
        <li>enter the git commit command with a commit message that describes what the commit contains. Enter the
          following git command in the command line: git commit -m "descriptive message"
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not
          all arrays must have multiple data types.
        </li>
        <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that
          the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be
          whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.
        </li>
        <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by
          allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the
          conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a
          specific number of times.
        </li>
        <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically
          execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in
          order to execute it</li>

        <li>Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is
          executed, or if it is executed at all</li>
      </ul>
