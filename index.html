      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It handles the content of
          a website, as well as its structure and the meaning of each element on the page. Along with CSS and
          JavaScript, HTML is one of the three core languages of the web.
        </li>
        <li>HTML = CONTENT IN WEBSITE - TEXT, IMAGES, BUTTONS, LINKS
        </li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested
          inside of a

          <body> element, those three nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all the
            children—in this case, the

            <body> element—is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to
              explain the relationship among elements in HTML.
